# (Un)Instal-Lister
This is very WIP, not really ready to use witouth major modification.
If you`re really interested, you will need to read and modify the code

The main idea behind this is that this run in a Samba server and get fetched by machines connected to the share, the script look if each software of the list is installed (or not) and decided, from the config, if it should install, uninstall, or let it there
